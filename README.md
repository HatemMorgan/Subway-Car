# Gameplay
The player controls a car that moves forward automatically on an infinite floor. The floor is divided into three lanes and throughout his/her journey, the player encounters Obstacles, Laser Radars, and Coins. The goal of the player is to collect as many of the coins scattered throughout the game as possible while avoiding the obstacles and radars. The player can make the car jump as well as steer it into one of the three lanes. The player should avoid being caught by the radar in order not to lose coins and should also avoid crashing into obstacles as much as he/she can. The game ends when the player crashes the car into an obstacle.
